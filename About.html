	<p class="fade article">  &emsp;Thanks for checking my page out.  If it isn't clear already my name is Michael Sefranek.  My degree is in Math, and I have a logical side, but I also have an artistic side. After college I worked in lawncare for 5 years. Despite feeling like a cog in the machine, I came out with a better understanding of the mechanics of business as well as a invaluable understanding of how to anticipate customer expectations.  3D modeling and printing <br>
	<br>
	 I'm a worker, a dreamer, and a growing entrepeneur.  Since 2015 I have self-taught myself the art (and science) of both 3D printing and 3D modeling.  Together with a good friend and associate I designed all the pieces for a small business making 3D printed terrain for miniature gamers. We've sold over 100 pieces in less than a year, and it has been a blast! Check it out here:<br>

	  In 2016 I was ecstatic to join Omaha Code School. This personal web-site was a result of my newest and growing skill set: web-development. I'm using it as a platform to both promote myself, my skills and my business ventures, and to practice improving at coding, and most importantly: to have fun with it.  Thanks for stopping by!</p>
