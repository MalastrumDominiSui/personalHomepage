		<p class="fade article">  &emsp;Thanks for checking my page out!  If it isn't clear already my name is Michael Sefranek.  I earned a degree in Mathematics in 2009. I have both a logical side, and an artistic side.  In the years following college I worked for a lawncare company. Despite feeling like a cog in the machine, I came out with a better understanding of the mechanics of business as well as an invaluable understanding of how to anticipate customer expectations.</p>

		 <p class="fade article">  &emsp;I'm a worker, a dreamer, and a growing entrepeneur.  Since 2015 I have self-taught myself the art (and science) of both 3D printing and 3D modeling. I designed all the pieces for a small business making 3D printed terrain for miniature gamers. We've sold over 100 pieces in less than a year, and it has been a blast! Check it out here:</p>

		 <p class="fade article">  &emsp;In 2016 I was ecstatic to join Omaha Code School. This personal web-site is the result of my newest and growing skill set: web-development. I'm using it as a platform to promote my own growth, my skills, and my business ventures. Most importantly: I'm having a lot of fun with it.  Thanks for stopping by!</p>
